# Unico Campania App - A first approach to app redesign

Fast redesign of the app, focusing on the main call to actions related to tickets - to check and validate your active ticket or buy a new one - and making the whole interface and components more iOS HIG compliant.

Native components to explore in this challenge:
- List and tables
- Modals (presenting sheet)
- Horizontal scroll view 
- Tab bar

Other functionalities:
- QR code generator (from a combination of a random alphanumeric string and the user mail)
- Use of timer
